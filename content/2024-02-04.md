Title: The Next Big Thing?

Due to recent layoffs, I start to think about what would
I want to do if I get hit. I'm thinking in the line of data systems.

I always want to have something that myself want to use, and
right now it is my distrust to SAAS products. So my proposal is:
You run your SAAS product, but the customer owns the data, fully.

What does that mean? It means users will have their own storage, and
services will have permissions to access those storage, likely within
their own namespace or something. Users take full control of their data,
and they can decide at any moment they don't want certain system to
access certain data anymore.

Realistically speaking, a user would need to have their own object storage
and kv store, and maybe later a SQL database, and maybe, a graph database.
But my guess is that, a user's data is actually not that much. That, and some
proper backups will  give me a peace of mind, not to worry about some random service 
will just delete my data, any data.

Does that mean everyone need to have their own server? Maybe yes, maybe no.
Maybe the storage should be something that everyone owns, like your phone. Oh, maybe
your phone can be that server. But people should be given that choice.

In such a world, buying an ebook means you have it in your storage. No one can delete it
for you. And if they do, don't call it a "buy".
