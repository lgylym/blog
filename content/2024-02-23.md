Title: Why change something when it was working? 
Category: Daily Logs

I noticed that in my team when I came back from a long leave. Suddenly things are
working differently, and the reason seems to be because we have a new manager (thus
new management style).

I guess one need to have it in their own ways. But why?

It is difficult to build a team that works, but so easy to tear it apart. I've witnessed two
times now. I don't want to see the third one.
