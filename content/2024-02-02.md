Title: Game PC?
Category: Daily Logs

Somehow I want to have a game PC now. Not that I have
any time nor do I really play games. Is this midlife crisis?

I did spend quite some time on games 20 years ago. Maybe it
is just how I want to relive the old times.

BTW, seems that at least for now a PC with `GeForce RTX 4060`
is more than enough for me.
